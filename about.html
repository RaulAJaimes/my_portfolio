                <p class="about-section-hobbies-p-txt">
                    I believe that reading is the best legacy that previous generations left us, since with it we can transmit knowledge and we can capture all the advances that humanity has achieved and will achieve.

                <p class="about-section-hobbies-p-txt">
                    Research is the evidence that humanity will never stop to achieve great advances, first it was the wheel, then the computer, then the internet, we always evolve to improve and therefore it is essential to be updated on the advances that are being worked on and those that have been achieved.

                <p class="about-section-hobbies-p-txt">
                    Our mind needs to recharge and there is nothing better for this than breaking the routine by visiting towns and socializing with their people, they are experiences that nourish our lives, our minds and our being.
